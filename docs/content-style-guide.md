# ElevatED Content Style Guide (v1)

- Audience: grades 3–8; default to plain, concrete language and short sentences. Avoid idioms and sarcasm. Prefer active voice.
- Tone: encouraging, concise, and specific (“Try this next…”). Name the goal up front before steps.
- Reading level: target grade band minus ~1 for scaffolded text; keep sentences ≤20 words where possible.
- Structure: start with a short hook/context, then numbered steps or bullets. Surface key terms in bold once, then use them consistently.
- Explanations: pair a short definition with one worked example; immediately contrast with a common mistake. Include a check-for-understanding question.
- Math: show one model (tape, array, number line, table, or graph) before symbolic form. Label units and variables; avoid unnecessary decimals/complex numbers in middle-school content.
- ELA: require one cited detail for any claim; provide one sentence frame for responses (“According to the text, … because …”). Include a quick vocabulary gloss for domain terms.
- Science: anchor with a phenomenon/observation, then evidence → reasoning. Use CER language; call out measurement units and uncertainty when relevant.
- Social Studies: insist on sourcing (who/when/why) for any primary source; separate fact from inference; encourage multiple perspectives.
- Accessibility: describe visuals briefly in alt-text style; avoid color-only cues. Keep instructions linear and scannable.
- Difficulty scale (1–5): 1 preview/remedial, 3 on-grade core, 5 stretch/challenge. Default to 3 unless specified.
