## Image Generation Prompts

### 1. Geometric Transformations (Math, Grades 6-12)
```
Educational diagram showing geometric transformations for middle school math: 
a clean, colorful illustration on a white background showing four types of 
transformations - rotation (a triangle rotating 90 degrees), reflection (a 
square reflected across a line), translation (a shape moving horizontally 
with an arrow), and dilation (a circle getting larger). Each transformation 
should be clearly labeled. Use bright, friendly colors (teal, purple, orange). 
Include a coordinate grid in the background for reference.
```

### 2. Fraction Visual Models (Math, Grades 2-5)
```
Educational diagram illustrating fraction concepts for elementary students: 
showing multiple visual representations of fractions. Include: 1) A circle 
divided into halves (1/2) with one half shaded, 2) A rectangle divided 
into fourths (1/4) with parts shaded, 3) A number line from 0 to 1 showing 
1/2 and 1/4 locations, 4) Equivalent fractions with bars showing 2/4 = 1/2. 
Use warm colors (light blue, coral, yellow, mint green). Child-friendly style.
```

### 3. Water Cycle (Science, Grades 3-6)
```
Educational science diagram showing the water cycle: clear illustration 
showing evaporation (water rising from ocean with arrows), condensation 
(clouds forming), precipitation (rain falling), and collection (water 
flowing into lakes). Each stage clearly labeled. Include sun, clouds, 
mountains, landscape. Vibrant educational colors. Professional textbook style.
```

### 4. Coordinate Plane (Math, Grades 5-8)
```
Educational math diagram showing a coordinate plane: Cartesian coordinate 
system with X and Y axes labeled. Show all four quadrants (I, II, III, IV). 
Include 3-4 plotted points like A(2,3), B(-3,1), C(-2,-2). Grid lines in 
light gray, axes in black with labels -5 to 5. Clean modern educational style.
```

### 5. Plot/Story Structure (ELA, Grades 3-8)
```
Educational diagram showing story structure: a clean arc diagram illustrating 
Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, and Resolution. Use a 
mountain-like curve with each element clearly labeled at the appropriate point. 
Include brief descriptions. Use purple and teal brand colors. Professional style.
```

### 6. Plant Life Cycle (Science, Grades 2-4)
```
Educational science diagram showing plant life cycle: circular flow showing 
Seed → Germination → Seedling → Adult Plant → Flower → Fruit → Seeds. 
Each stage illustrated with simple, friendly drawings. Arrows showing 
progression. Green and earth tones. Child-friendly, clear labels.
```

### 7. Area and Perimeter (Math, Grades 3-5)
```
Educational math diagram showing area and perimeter: two rectangles side by 
side. First rectangle shows perimeter with arrows around all sides and the 
formula P = 2l + 2w. Second rectangle shows area with grid squares inside 
and formula A = l × w. Both with example measurements. Clean, colorful style.
```

### 8. Solar System (Science, Grades 3-6)
```
Educational science diagram showing solar system: planets in order from Sun 
with relative sizes shown. Include Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, 
Saturn (with rings), Uranus, Neptune. Each planet labeled. Use accurate colors. 
Dark space background with white labels. Professional educational style.
