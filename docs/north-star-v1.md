ElevatED Learning Model (North Star)
ElevatED is an AI-assisted learning platform built around guided understanding, not passive consumption. Learning is modeled as an interactive teaching conversation that continuously checks, responds, and adapts to the learner.
The goal of every session is simple: ensure the learner actually understands before moving on.

Core Philosophy
	1	Teaching always comes first — but only in small, purposeful doses.
	2	Understanding must be demonstrated, not assumed.
	3	Practice is not separate from learning — it is learning.
	4	Adaptation happens in real time, based on learner responses.
	5	Progress is gated by understanding, not by reading or time spent.
ElevatED does not deliver lectures. It delivers guided learning experiences.

The Learning Session Engine
All learning is driven by a Session Engine, not static lessons or pages. A session is a sequence of steps, each with a clear instructional purpose.
Step Types
Every step is one of the following:
	1	Teach Step
	2	Check Step
	3	Respond Step
	4	Adapt Step
	5	Apply Step
These steps repeat until mastery is achieved.

1. Teach Step (Micro-Teaching)
Every concept begins with an explicit Teach Step.
Purpose: Introduce exactly one idea — no more, no less.
Rules:
	•	3–6 sentences maximum
	•	One core concept
	•	One concrete example
	•	No assumptions about prior knowledge
Teaching should answer the learner’s immediate question:
“What do I need to know to think about this?”
This step establishes fairness — learners are never tested on something they haven’t been taught.

2. Check Step (Immediate Understanding Check)
Immediately after teaching, the learner must respond.
Purpose: Confirm whether the learner understood what was just taught.
Rules:
	•	Question directly maps to the Teach Step
	•	No trick questions
	•	Minimal cognitive load
	•	Always required (never skippable)
If no predefined question exists, one is automatically generated.
Understanding is not inferred — it is demonstrated.

3. Respond Step (Feedback + Teaching)
The system responds immediately to the learner’s input.
If correct:
	•	Brief confirmation
	•	Short reinforcement of why it’s correct
If incorrect or partially correct:
	•	Explain the mistake
	•	Re-teach the concept differently
	•	Use examples, analogies, or visuals
Feedback is instructional, not judgmental.

4. Adapt Step (Decision Engine)
After feedback, the system decides what happens next.
Possible outcomes:
	•	Advance to the next micro-concept
	•	Re-teach the same concept with a simpler explanation
	•	Ask a similar question with scaffolding
	•	Increase difficulty if confidence is high
	•	Trigger AI tutor intervention
This decision is based on:
	•	Accuracy
	•	Confidence
	•	Hesitation
	•	Repeated errors
Adaptation is automatic and invisible to the learner.

5. Apply Step (Deeper Understanding)
Once basic understanding is demonstrated, learners apply the concept.
Purpose: Move from recognition → reasoning → real use.
Application may include:
	•	Word problems
	•	Comparisons
	•	Real-world scenarios
	•	“Explain it in your own words”
This step confirms durable understanding, not memorization.

Mastery & Progression
	•	Learners progress only after reaching a mastery threshold.
	•	Mastery is determined by consistent correct reasoning, not a single answer.
	•	There is no “read and move on” path.
Every learner — regardless of role — experiences the same learning flow.

Role of the AI Tutor
The AI tutor is proactive, not optional.
It:
	•	Intervenes when confusion is detected
	•	Re-explains concepts in different styles
	•	Encourages struggling learners
	•	Accelerates confident learners
	•	Answers “why” and “what if” questions contextually
The tutor behaves like a patient, adaptive instructor — not a chatbot on the side.

What ElevatED Is Not
	•	Not a markdown reader
	•	Not a slide deck
	•	Not “lesson first, quiz later”
	•	Not optional practice
	•	Not passive learning

Outcome
ElevatED learning feels like:
	•	A guided conversation
	•	A fair and supportive teacher
	•	Constant interaction
	•	Clear progress tied to understanding
When a learner finishes a session, they don’t just feel “done” — they know they understand.
