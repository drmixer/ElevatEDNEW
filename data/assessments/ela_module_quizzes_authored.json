        "prompt": "Read the passage:\n\nPhotosynthesis is a process that plants use to make their own food. Plants need sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. Inside the leaves, a green substance called chlorophyll captures energy from the sun. This energy helps the plant turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose, which is a type of sugar. The plant uses glucose as food to grow and stay healthy. Photosynthesis also produces oxygen, which all animals need to breathe. Without photosynthesis, life on Earth would not exist.\n\nWhat is the main idea of this passage?",
